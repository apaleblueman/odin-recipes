    <p>The Sandwich of Death, as featured on Regular Show, is no ordinary meatball sub. But you won't kick the bucket when you bite in, even though the taste is to die for.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup spaghetti or pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup BBQ sauce</li>
        <li>Split-top sub rolls, cut lengthwise</li>
        <li>Package of sliced sandwich pepperoni</li>
        <li>Package of small sliced Canadian bacon</li>
        <h3>Meatballs</h3>
        <ul>            
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 pound ground turkey</li>
            <li>4 oz. chopped prosciutto</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/4 cup shredded parmesan</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons plain breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh Italian parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Pinch of ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350 F, and spray a large baking dish with non-stick spray (you can butter it, too). </li>
        <li>Combine all of the meatball ingredients in a large bowl. Form them into ping pong-sized balls, and put them in the prepared dish in a single layer. Cover with foil and bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes. After they've finished cooking, remove the meatballs.</li>
        <li>Combine the spaghetti or pizza sauce with the BBQ sauce, and spread on an opened sub roll. Cover with alternating layers of pepperoni and Canadian bacon. Top with a row of meatballs, then sprinkle on parmesan and fresh parsley.</li>
    </ol>
