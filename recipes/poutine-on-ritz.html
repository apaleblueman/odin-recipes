        <li>2 teaspoons black peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon green peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worchestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 sprigs parsley</li>
        <li>2 sprigs thyme</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 pound frozen, wide-cut steak fries, fried as directed</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter, room temperature (for buns)</li>
        <li>4 sesame seed buns, split</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for pan</li>
        <li>1½ pounds ground beef chuck (20% fat)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise, dill pickle slices, cheddar cheese curds or halloumi, and chopped chives for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover the mushrooms with boiling water in a small bowl, and let them sit until they're tender. Strain the mushrooms and save the soaking liquid.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the flour and cook until the mixture is deep golden brown and smells nutty (about 2-4 minutes). Set this mixture aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onions, shallots, leeks, and garlic and stir until they're caramelized (about 10-12 minutes). Add the tomato paste and cook for another minute or two. Add the mushrooms and their soaking liquid, demi-glace, black and green peppercorns, vinegar, Worchestershire, parsley, thyme, and bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 30 minutes. Strain this stock into a large bowl and toss the solids.</li>
        <li>Put the stock back in a suacepan and bring to a boil. Whisk in the flour mixture (roux) from earlier and stir until the gravy is thick and smooth (about 2-3 minutes). Butter and toast the buns in a large griddle or cast-iron skillet.</li>
        <li>Heat the griddle or skillet until very hot and lightly brush it with oil. Divide the beef into 4 equal portions (not patties), and transfer each to the griddle. Smash them to form imperfect patties. Season with salt and pepper and cook until they're browned around the edges (about 2 minutes). Turn and repeat on the other side.</li>
        <li>Transfer each patty to a bun, and garnish as desired with toppings and the gravy. Just don't forget the fries!</li>
    </ol>
